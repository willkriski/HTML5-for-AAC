Looking for help!!! Not just coders :)

-determining a logical layout of images for use by children (how should images be laid out, what's on first page, second page, etc)
-generating audio files and versions (mp3, ogg, etc) for each word (or using text to speech features if online)
-finding users to test out the app and provide feedback
-getting funding from organizations and people so I can keep working on this full time
